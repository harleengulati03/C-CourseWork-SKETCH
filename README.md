# C-CourseWork-SKETCH

displayfull is a module used for graphics and one which is heavily used by sketch.c
sketch.c takes in a .sk file and returns the visual output of this .sk file to the user
converter.c makes use of displayfull.h to convert .pgm images to .sk images

to see an idea of how converter.c works, two short videos have been provided of their output.
